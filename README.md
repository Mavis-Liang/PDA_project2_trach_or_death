# Predicting Tracheostomy/Death in Neonates with Severe BPD

## Description

This project is focused on the development of a regression model to predict the composite outcome of tracheostomy or death in neonates with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (sBPD). The timing and criteria for tracheostomy placement in this patient population are subjects of ongoing debate within the medical community. Accurate prediction of the need for tracheostomy at early postmenstrual ages (PMA) is of paramount importance, as it can significantly impact clinical decision-making and counseling for families.

We utilized a national dataset containing demographic, diagnostic, and respiratory parameters of infants with sBPD. The project involves thorough data preprocessing to handle missing data and account for variations introduced by data collected from multiple medical centers. We employ regression modeling to predict the composite outcome of tracheostomy placement or death, offering insights into when and for whom tracheostomy may be necessary.
